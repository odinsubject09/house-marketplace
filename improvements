1.in sign up form add a loading gif since fetch api takes time
2.also check if email id already exists when signing in
3.add restriction to api keys
4.add phone number also in signIn
5.where we are sending message in contact page do something to connect it to wsapp

6.for ease of user in the create listing form when they add their address and they want their lat and lng create a button 'get latitude and longitude'by connecting this to a url of a lat service provider where you directly fill the users adress and the user only has to copy the respective latitude and longitude
doing this because google geocode api needs card details
